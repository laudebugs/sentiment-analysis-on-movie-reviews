The conflict in the story escalates when West witnesses a police shooting. It quickly becomes clear to her that the cops who are involved aren't going to be willing to take their chances with the criminal justice system.

West, who grew up in New Orleans, has to figure out who to trust as she's on the run in her old neighborhood.

While the movie is set in New Orleans, it's definitely not the New Orleans you see in ads or posters trying to lure tourists to the city.

There are no scenes of Bourbon Street or the French Quarter. There are no scenes of Mardi Gras or jazz musicians playing on street corners. No one even mentions red beans and rice or gumbo.

This film is set in the New Orleans that tourists are warned about.

The story takes place in parts of city that haven't recovered from Hurricane Katrina. Parts of the city that weren't doing all that well even before the hurricane hit.

"Black and Blue" doesn't exactly break new ground. There are plenty of characters you've seen the likes of in similar movies involving rogue cops.

Tyrese Gibson plays Milo "Mouse" Jackson, a hard-working man who knew West back in the day but is now leery of his former neighbor. Mike Colter (the "Luke Cage" TV series) plays Darius, who runs the neighborhood drug trade. Frank Grillo ("The Grey," "Point Blank") is sufficiently evil as the lead corrupt cop.

But director Deon Taylor ("The Intruder," "Traffik") keeps the action moving along at a swift enough pace to keep you on edge.

West, who left the city as a teenager to join the Army and served in Afghanistan, says at one point she came home and became a police officer because she wanted to help, to "be the change."

You'll wonder throughout the film if she'll get that chance.
