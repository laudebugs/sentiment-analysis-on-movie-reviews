The beginning of the film tells us that it is the near future, a time of both hope and conflict. Advancements at NASA and space exploration are greater than the current state in real life. There are extensive space stations on both the moon and Mars making them somewhat habitable places.  Roy McBride is a renowned astronaut working for NASA. His father was also an astronaut but went missing in space decades prior.  News has spread within NASA that there are solar rays coming from Neptune causing power surges on Earth. They believe this may be a sign that Roy’s father may still be alive.

Starring: Brad Pitt, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland, Ruth Negga, Kimberly Elise.

-I say this as a warning that you have to go in with an open mind. This isn’t a film about modern day space realism. There are lofty concepts from the beginning as well as tangible realities within this world writer/director James Gray created including an action sequence on the moon between a NASA rover and some astronauts who have gone rogue.

-Gray is less concerned about the specific science involved and instead using the moon, Mars, and Neptune as set pieces for this intimate and complicated father/son story.  It has the futurist look of Blade Runner or 2001: A Space Odyssey but with a meditative vibe to it.

-The relationship between Roy and his father was cut short and we see how decades of the unknown has taken an emotional toll on Roy. There’s anger and resentment with Roy as we realize that his father essentially chose space and the unknown over his family. The public and media love and cherish his father’s work but there is this other side to his story. We also see Roy wrestle with if he’s wanted for his own accomplishments and work ethic or for being the son of Clifford McBride.

-As Roy, Brad Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career. It’s a deeply internalized performance but one where we can see and know everything he’s feeling just by looking in his eyes. He has to carry quite a bit of this film himself, not only physically on screen but also by his voice over narration detailing his inner thoughts and struggles with what he’s going through. Pitt reminds you of the quiet power he can have over a story.

-There’s a singular focus in Ad Astra as Roy confronts the relationship he had his father. It asks the audience how long a person should suffer for the sins of their father before they and others can move on. Roy has a personal and professional mission, and there are fatal consequences along the way with the choices he makes. With this, the film comes with a slower pace, a story that floats around not always sure of where its going, the audience don’t really get to know the various supporting characters, but this all fits Roy’s uncertain state of mind.

Is It Worth Your Trip to the Movies? It may not be as crowd-pleasing as The Martian, but one that shouldn’t be missed on a massive movie theater screen with immersive sound.
