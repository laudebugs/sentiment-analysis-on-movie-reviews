In the newspaper interview that awkwardly frames Xavier Dolan’s latest, a grumpy journalist questions whether the sad life of John F. Donovan is not a case of First World problems. Actor Rupert Turner, who has published his childhood correspondence with the late TV star, charmingly convinces her the story is universal. But this journalist is not buying it. Shifting between the bullied 11-year-old Rupert (a mouthy Jacob Tremblay) and the closeted Donovan (a mournful Kit Harington), Dolan’s English-language debut whinges about personal neuroses rather than probing homophobia or celebrity. There may be good reasons that in the mid-2000s Donovan remains as closeted as Rock Hudson, but Susan Sarandon’s amusing turn as his smothering alcoholic mother is hardly justification for waltzing down red carpets with a beard. As the second domineering mom, an underused Natalie Portman can’t decipher why her character isn’t more sympathetic to the sweet little Rupert. Perhaps explanations for all these improbable scenarios were lost on the cutting-room floor during Dolan’s notoriously prolonged editing process.
